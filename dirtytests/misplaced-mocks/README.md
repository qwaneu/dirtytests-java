# Misplaced Mocks

This codebase is about sending password resets to registered users by e-mail.

Refactor these tests to reduce duplication and unnecessary use of mock objects.

- What are the different concerns being covered by the tests?
- Try out different ways of reducing the use of mocks. Can you rewrite the test
so that it does not use Mockito at all?
